No explanation, otherwise it defeats the purpose :)

## Features
- No more blind registering(*at least no more completely blind registering*)
- Option for next semester will appear **1 month before it starts**(*untill the website is changed or taken down*)

## Warning
**I don't guarantee the accuracy of the information you'll get.**

**It might change at any time**, but this tool might help you to see the "outline" of your upcoming semester schedule.

## Install

Get the latest version from **[releases page](https://github.com/w04m1/schedule-hack/releases)** (instructions included)

This project was bootstrapped with [Chrome Extension CLI](https://github.com/dutiyesh/chrome-extension-cli)
(and I actually liked this tool)
